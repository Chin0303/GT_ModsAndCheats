        <h1>Welcome to GT Mods and Cheats</h1>
        <p>An information page to explain the difference between mods and cheats in GorillaTag.</p>

        <h1>Mods and Cheats</h1>
        <div class="info-section">
            <h2>Mods</h2>
            <p>Mods are created by a community/group of people that really like a game. They spend their free time to create mods for a game they like and appreciate. Mods don't harm the developers of the game or interrupt vanilla players their experience when playing a game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-section">
            <h2>Cheats</h2>
            <p>Cheats are designed to interrupt and annoy players and developers. The goal of cheats is to gain an advantage over other players and make other players have a bad experience when playing the game.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="modscheats-info-container">
        <h1>Common Cheats</h1>
        <div class="info-section">
            <h2>Cosmetix</h2>
            <p>Cosmetix is a cheat that gives you access to every cosmetic in the game. This is obviously not allowed since this makes it useless to actually buy them. The developers main income is from ingame purchases like cosmetics, so you are only causing harm to the game.</p>
            <p>It doesnt matter if the ingame item is purchasable or not, there is a reason why you dont have it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-section">
            <h2>Mod/Cheat Menus</h2>
            <p>Probably the most known cheats are mod/cheat menus. A mod/cheat menu is a cheat that has a bunch of cheats bundled together on a big menu. Most of the time they contain malware, spyware or harm your computer. You should never use a cheat/mod menu or even have it on your computer.</p>
            <p>A common mistake made is people saying "mod/cheat menus are allowed in modded rooms only", which is not true. Modded rooms are created for people to use mods that would normally interrupt vanilla players their experience, but they dont harm the game.</p>

            <h2>Notice</h2>
            <p>Please note that using cheats in games can have serious consequences, including getting banned and potentially damaging your device with malware or viruses. Always know what you install and run.</p>
